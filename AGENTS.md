# Creating New Statistics

The project analyzes OpenStreetMap changesets through preprocessed parquet files partitioned by year and month and includes columns for analysis.

## Dataset Structure

The dataset is located at `../changeset_data/year=*/month=*/*.parquet` and contains the following key columns:

### Base Columns
- `edit_count` - Number of edits in the changeset
- `user_name` - OSM contributor username
- `year` - Year of the changeset
- `month` - Month of the changeset

### Enriched Columns (added by `scripts/enrich_table.py`)
- `created_by` - Normalized editing software name
- `device_type` - Classification: `desktop_editor`, `mobile_editor`, `tool`, `other`
- `bot` - Boolean indicating if the changeset was made by a bot
- `mid_pos_x`, `mid_pos_y` - Discretized coordinates (0-360, 0-180)
- `imagery_used` - Array of imagery sources used
- `hashtags` - Array of hashtags from the changeset
- `source` - Array of data sources used
- `mobile_os` - Mobile OS detection (`Android`, `iOS`, or `NULL`)
- `streetcomplete_quest` - Normalized StreetComplete quest type
- `all_tags` - Array of all tag prefixes used
- `organised_team` - Organised team/corporation affiliation if applicable
- `for_profit` - Boolean indicating if the changeset was made by a for-profit organisation

## Core Patterns and Examples

### Pattern 1: Basic Time Series Analysis

**Example: Monthly Contributors/Edits/Changesets**

```python
df = duckdb.sql("""
WITH user_first_appearance AS (
    SELECT
        user_name,
        year,
        month,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY user_name ORDER BY year, month) as rn
    FROM (
        SELECT DISTINCT user_name, year, month
        FROM '../changeset_data/year=*/month=*/*.parquet'
    )
),
first_appearances AS (
    SELECT user_name, year, month
    FROM user_first_appearance
    WHERE rn = 1
),
monthly_metrics AS (
    SELECT
        year,
        month,
        CONCAT(year, '-', LPAD(CAST(month as VARCHAR), 2, '0')) as months,
        COUNT(DISTINCT user_name) as Contributors,
        CAST(SUM(edit_count) as BIGINT) as Edits,
        CAST(COUNT(*) AS INTEGER) as Changesets
    FROM '../changeset_data/year=*/month=*/*.parquet'
    GROUP BY year, month
),
monthly_new_contributors AS (
    SELECT
        year,
        month,
        COUNT(DISTINCT user_name) as "New Contributors"
    FROM first_appearances
    GROUP BY year, month
),
combined_metrics AS (
    SELECT
        m.year,
        m.month,
        m.months,
        m.Contributors,
        COALESCE(n."New Contributors", 0) as "New Contributors",
        m.Edits,
        m.Changesets
    FROM monthly_metrics m
    LEFT JOIN monthly_new_contributors n ON m.year = n.year AND m.month = n.month
)
SELECT
    months,
    Contributors,
    "New Contributors",
    Edits,
    Changesets,
    SUM("New Contributors") OVER (ORDER BY year, month) as "Accumulated Contributors",
    SUM(Edits) OVER (ORDER BY year, month) as "Accumulated Edits",
    SUM(Changesets) OVER (ORDER BY year, month) as "Accumulated Changesets"
FROM combined_metrics
ORDER BY year, month
""").df()

util.show_figure(
    [
        util.FigureConfig(
            title="Monthly Contributors",
            label="Contributors",
            x_col="months",
            y_col="Contributors",
            query_or_df=df,
        ),
        util.FigureConfig(
            title="Monthly Edits",
            label="Edits", 
            x_col="months",
            y_col="Edits",
            query_or_df=df,
        )
    ]
)
```

### Pattern 2: Top N Analysis with Groups

**Example: Top 10 Editing Software**

```python
df = duckdb.sql("""
WITH top_software AS (
    SELECT created_by
    FROM (
        SELECT
            created_by,
            COUNT(DISTINCT user_name) as total_contributors
        FROM '../changeset_data/year=*/month=*/*.parquet'
        WHERE created_by IS NOT NULL
        GROUP BY created_by
        ORDER BY total_contributors DESC
        LIMIT 10
    )
),
monthly_contributors AS (
    SELECT 
        year,
        month,
        CONCAT(year, '-', LPAD(CAST(month as VARCHAR), 2, '0')) as months,
        created_by,
        COUNT(DISTINCT user_name) as "Contributors",
        SUM(edit_count) as "Edit Count"
    FROM '../changeset_data/year=*/month=*/*.parquet'
    WHERE created_by IN (SELECT created_by FROM top_software)
    GROUP BY year, month, created_by
)
SELECT * FROM monthly_contributors
ORDER BY year, month, created_by
""").df()

util.show_figure(
    [
        util.FigureConfig(
            title="Monthly Contributors by Top 10 Editing Software",
            label="Contributors",
            x_col="months",
            y_col="Contributors",
            group_col="created_by",
            query_or_df=df,
        )
    ]
)
```

### Pattern 3: Percentage Analysis

**Example: Percentage Contributors by Software**

```python
df = duckdb.sql("""

    SELECT created_by
    FROM (
        SELECT
            created_by,

    WHERE created_by IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY year, month

SELECT 
    msc.months,
    msc.created_by,
    ROUND((msc.contributors * 100.0) / mtc.total_contributors, 2) as 'Percentage of Contributors'

            group_col="created_by",
            query_or_df=df,

### Pattern 4: Geographical Analysis

**Example: Edit Distribution Map**

```python
df = duckdb.sql("""
SELECT
    mid_pos_x as x,
    mid_pos_y as y,
    SUM(edit_count) as z
FROM '../changeset_data/year=*/month=*/*.parquet'

## Utility Functions Reference

### Figure Configuration (`util.FigureConfig`)

```python
@dataclass
class FigureConfig:
    title: str                           # Chart title
    x_col: str                          # X-axis column name
    y_col: str                          # Y-axis column name
    z_col: str = None                   # Z-axis for maps
    query_or_df: str | pd.DataFrame     # SQL query or DataFrame
    group_col: str = None               # Column for grouping traces
    label: str = None                   # Label for button in multi-chart
    y_unit_hover_template: str = None   # Unit for hover template (e.g., "%")
    plot_type: str = "scatter"          # "scatter", "bar", or "map"
    trace_names: list[str] = None       # Custom ordering of traces
```

### Table Configuration (`util.TableConfig`)

```python
class TableConfig(NamedTuple):
    title: str                          # Table title
    query_or_df: str | pd.DataFrame     # SQL query or DataFrame  
    x_axis_col: str                     # Column for pivot table columns
    y_axis_col: str                     # Column for pivot table rows
    value_col: str                      # Column for pivot table values
    center_columns: tuple[str] = ()     # Columns to center-align
    sum_col: str = None                 # Column for sorting
```

## SQL Patterns and Best Practices

### Common SQL Patterns

1. Month Formatting: 
    ```sql
    CONCAT(year, '-', LPAD(CAST(month as VARCHAR), 2, '0')) as months
    ```

2. Window Functions for First Appearance:
   ```sql
   ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY user_name ORDER BY year, month) as rn
   ```

3. Accumulated Values:
   ```sql
   SUM(column) OVER (ORDER BY year, month) as "Accumulated Column"
   ```

4. Top N Selection:
   ```sql
   WITH top_n AS (
       SELECT column
       FROM table
       ORDER BY metric DESC
       LIMIT n
   )
   ```

5. Percentage Calculations:
   ```sql
   ROUND((subset_count * 100.0) / total_count, 2) as percentage
   ```

## Performance Considerations

### Query Optimization
- Use CTEs (Common Table Expressions) for complex queries
- Filter early in the query pipeline
- Use appropriate aggregations before JOINs
- Consider partitioning when accessing specific time ranges

## Advanced Features

### Dropdown Charts for Year-by-Year Analysis
```python
configs = []
for year in sorted(df["year"].unique()):
    configs.append(
        util.FigureConfig(
            title=f"Edit Count {year}",
            x_col="x",
            y_col="y",
            z_col="z",
            query_or_df=df[df["year"] == year],
            plot_type="map",
        )
    )
util.show_figure(configs, type="dropdown")
```

### Custom Trace Ordering
```python
# Get trace names ordered by last value, unique values, or first value
trace_names = util.get_trace_names(df, "group_col", "x_col", "y_col", "last")
# Options: "last", "first", "unique"

util.FigureConfig(
    # ... other parameters ...
    trace_names=trace_names
)
```

### Multi-Chart Figures with Button Navigation
```python
util.show_figure(
    [

### Array Column Expansion (Unnesting)
```python
# For columns containing arrays (like source, hashtags, imagery_used)
WITH source_expanded AS (
    SELECT 
        year,
        month,
        user_name,
        edit_count,
        unnest(source) as source_tag
    FROM '../changeset_data/year=*/month=*/*.parquet'
    WHERE source IS NOT NULL
)
```

### HTML Link Integration
```python
# Load replacement rules for clickable links
with open("../config/replace_rules_created_by.json") as f:
    editing_software_name_to_html_link = {
        name: f'<a href="{item["link"]}">{name}</a>' for name, item in json.load(f).items() if "link" in item
    }

df["Editing Software"] = df["Editing Software"].apply(
    lambda name: editing_software_name_to_html_link[name] if name in editing_software_name_to_html_link else name
)
# There are also ../config/replace_rules_imagery_and_source.json
```
