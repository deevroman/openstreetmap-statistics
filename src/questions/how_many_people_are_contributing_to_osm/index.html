<h1>How many people are contributing to OSM?</h1>

<p>
OpenStreetMap has grown a lot since the beginning in 2006.
The first plot shows how many people add or change something in OSM each month.
There was a big increase of monthly contributors in in 2016, and since then the monthly contributor count is at around 45 thousand.
</p>
<div id="general_contributor_count_monthly" class="dataDiv"></div>
<p>
The next plot is about new OSM contributors per month again to compare how many people contribute to OSM for the first time each month.
Here you can also see the big spike in 2016 and since then the number is slowly declining.
Compared to the monthly contributor the number of new contributors each month was unexpectly high for me.
This means there are many people who start contributing but don't do it regualary.
</p>
<div id="general_new_contributor_count_monthly" class="dataDiv"></div>
<p>
The next plots shows the monthly contributors without people only contributing with maps.me iOS or Android app.
It shows that the spike in 2016 is from new contributors using the app.
</p>
<div id="general_no_maps_me_contributor_count_monthly" class="dataDiv"></div>
<p>
Looking at the total contributor count reveals that over the lifetime of the OSM project many people contributed to the map.
The total number should be an overestimation of total people, because there might people who contribute with two or more accounts.
</p>
<div id="general_new_contributor_count_monthly_accumulated" class="dataDiv"></div>
<p>
With the next plot I try to answer how active are contributors split by how many edits they made in total.
</p>
<div id="general_contributor_count_more_the_k_edits_monthly" class="dataDiv"></div>
<p>
Looking more closely at the contributors, how many edits does den median edits make per month?
</p>
