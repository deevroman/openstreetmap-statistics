<h1>How many people are contributing to OpenStreetMap?</h1>

<p>
OpenStreetMap has grown a lot since the beginning in 2006.
The first plot shows how many people add or change something in OSM each month.
There was a big increase of monthly contributors in in 2016, and since then the monthly contributor count is at around 45 thousend.
</p>
<div id="general_contributor_count_monthly" class="dataDiv", style="display: inline-block;"></div>
<p>
The next plot is about new OSM contributors per month again to compare how many people contribute to OSM for the first time each month.
Here you can also see the big spike in 2016 and since then the number is slowly declining.
Compared to the monthly contributor the number of new contributors each month was unexpectly high.
This means there are many people who start contributing but don't do it regualary.
</p>
<div id="general_new_contributor_count_monthly" class="dataDiv", style="display: inline-block;"></div>
<p>
The next plots shows the monthly contributors without people only contributing with maps.me iOS or Android app.
It shows that the spike in 2016 is from new contributors using the app.
</p>
<div id="general_no_maps_me_contributor_count_monthly" class="dataDiv", style="display: inline-block;"></div>
<p>
The next plot shows how many contributors there are per month with at least 10 to 100000 edits.
